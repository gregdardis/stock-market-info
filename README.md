# Stock Market Info  

## Description
Stock Market Info is a project built with react-redux. 
The (currently) single-page web app has a search bar to search for stocks in the yahoo api, then print various information about the stock searched in a grid.

NOTE: Back end access to the yahoo API is not set up yet. Only the grid and search bar have been set up, with the grid displaying hardcoded values for a made-up stock.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`
4. `npm run start`
5. Open http://localhost:8080 in the browser
